This is just and example of the format the output file can take
Jule
Lana 
Olympe 
Darla 
Arlie 

There HAS to be a line of text before listing each group (like this one)
Jerrilee 
Garret 
Kyle 
Goldie 
Michal 

It can have anything in it! As long as it is only 1 line. 
Pascale 
Paulette 
Leroy 
Geoffrey 
Clifford 

I recommend putting helpful info about the group on this line for easier debugging
Kelwin 
Barthel 
Wallis 
Kathryn 
Luther 






There can be any number of spaces between groups, but no newlines between group member names
Moishe 
Marnie 
Spud 
Sharla 
Jaquelyn
